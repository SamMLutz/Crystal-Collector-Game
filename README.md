# Cystal collector game
  For this project I have created a number guessing game with 4 separate options using crystals for my buttons. 
  To begin the game you will hit the "start button". Upon button click we use javascripts "math" method to generate a random number as the goal 
  to be met. Also upon click random numbers will be generated and assigned to each crystal button (new numbers will be generated 
  for each new game). As you click the crytsal buttons you will add the corresponding number value to your "total score". If you 
  correctly add the values to reach the "target Number" you will recieve a winner message and your win will be tallied in the
  wins column. If you go over the target number you will tallied in the losses column. In this project we use jquery to perform
  our on click functions, as well as to to dynamically add our numbers and scores to the page.
